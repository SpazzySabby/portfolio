I had a lot of fun learning about Bootstrap and everything it is capable of, I understand that with this assignment I am just scratching the surface of what is possible. The main challenge I faced when it came to this assignment 
was falling ill last week to some mysterious illness, the fever alone reset my brain and I felt like I started this assignment from minus square one. I managed to hammer down all the components I came across in the rubric which
will keep me above a passing grade. I feel that compared to my prototypes there is a lot of work to be done here, although I am happy with what I could accomplish in the short time I had left after all was said and done with illness,
other projects, and work involved. I really had to push myself to stay focused with the limited time as well, teaching myself with enough mini-breaks I can accomplish my goals! If I didn't have the illness setback earlion I would
have loved to create some SASS files and really used my custom colors from XD, instead, I used some basic colors to show I understand the concept.
